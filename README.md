# Puppeteer Webscraping Crypto
 This was an experiment to use Puppeteer (A node.js library) to pull values on certain cryptocurrenies through specific websites and compare the values.

The process for setup is simple, you do 'npm install' to install everything in the package-lock.json file and obtain the node.js (The reason the node.js files are not here is because the files were too large to update to the repository). You can also use 'npm install Puppeteer'

Once that is done, you simply run the scrapers.js and it'll webscrape information from two different exchange sites regarding the values of BTC and ETH from the specific sites and output the values via console log.
